<p>Wiimote on linux</p>

<p>Will is a simple program made in python using python-cwiid and python-xlib to control the X server with a wiimote.
The program is configurable to use the motion plus or the nunchuk as mouse pointer.</p>

<p>=== Use it ===</p>

<p>1.install python-cwiid and python-xlib on your system</p>

<p>2.edit config.yml with the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>mouse = [motion|nunchuck]</li>
<li>offset = [0-100]</li>
<li>mouse is the type of control you want to use, offset is the pixel you move at each movement

<ol>
<li>python will.py</li>
<li>enjoy your wiimote</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><p>=== Info ===</p>

<p>I've created this software cause i'm far from an eletronic shop to buy ir leds and build a irda bar (yes, you can argue me that i didn't use 2 candles for trying, but i'm lazy)
I'm very optimist about the motion plus, it's a great piece of hw to use and to hack.</p>

<p>I've set for now simple actions with buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li>A: left mouse click</li>
<li>B: right mouse click</li>
<li>+: zoom in</li>
<li>-: zoom out</li>
<li>home: reset pointer to center of screen</li>
</ul><p>I'll get them configurable very soon.
Best use is with a raspberry pi, on board screen and a television, you can browse internet directly from wiimote without a mouse and a keyboard.</p>
